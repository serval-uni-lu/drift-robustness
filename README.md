# Drift retraining schedules replication package


## Introduction

This package contains all the necessary data and scripts to replicate the experiments of our research paper "Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Machine Learning Systems
in Production" on public data.


## Create the environment

We recommend using [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and Python 3.8.10 on a Linux system.

```
conda create -n drift-study python=3.8.10
conda activate drift-study
pip install -r requirements-lock.txt
```

For windows, we recommend using the ``requirements-lock-win.txt`` requirements file instead.

## File structure

- config: configurations files used to prepare and run the experiments
- data: the source data set and the results generated by our experiments
    - optmizer_results: the result of the evaluation of the retraining schedules
- drift_study: python modules to run the experiments
- reports: the final reports of the experiments as tables(.csv) and figures (.html)
- scripts: the script to run an experiment

## Unzip the data

```
./script/unzip_data.sh
```

## Usage

Run the following command to run an experiment $rq among [rq1, rq2, rq3, rq4].
```
conda activate drift-study
chmod +x ./script/lcld_${rq}.sh
./script/lcld_${rq}.sh
```
Note that by default, to limit computational costs, only the final reports generation is executed from pre-computed results.
Feel free to uncomment python commands in ``./script/lcld_${rq}.sh`` to run the complete experiments.


The reports are found in ``./reports/lcld_201317_ds_time/$rq.[csv|html]``
